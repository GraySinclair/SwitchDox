[{"tag_name":"v1.02-switch","name":"Hurrican port for Switch v1.02","body":"# Hurrican port for Switch\r\n\r\nThis is my Switch port of Hurrican, a freeware jump and shoot game created by Poke53280 that is based on the Turrican game series. Blast your way through nine action-packed levels filled with different enemies and powerups.\r\n\r\nEverything needed to play is already included in the archive.\r\n\r\nPort by @rsn8887.\r\n\r\nVisit my Patreon:\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/rsn8887\r\n\r\n![](/Hurrican/switchdata/screenshots/Hurrican_Switch_1.jpg)\r\n![](/Hurrican/switchdata/screenshots/Hurrican_Switch_2.jpg)\r\n![](/Hurrican/switchdata/screenshots/Hurrican_Switch_3.jpg)\r\n![](/Hurrican/switchdata/screenshots/Hurrican_Switch_4.jpg)\r\n![](/Hurrican/switchdata/screenshots/Hurrican_Switch_5.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Thanks\r\n\r\nThanks to Poke53280 team for making such a great game, releasing the source, and making it freeware. \r\n\r\nThanks to the other developers such as DKS and Pickle for extending the Hurrican source and adding SDL/OpenGL-ES support and more.\r\n\r\nThanks to ScHlAuChi for telling me about this.\r\n\r\nThanks to devkitPro for making Switch homebrew possible.\r\n\r\nThanks to my Patreon supporters: Andyways, Count Duckula, Jesse Harlin, Thomas Luten, Matthew Machnee, Mored4u, Ibrahim Fazel Poor, RadicalR.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n- Download (see `assets` below), and unzip `Hurrican_switch.zip` and copy the contents over to the `/switch/` folder on your sd card, so that you have a folder `/switch/Hurrican` with many folders and files inside.\r\n\r\n# Controls\r\n\r\n - Left analog stick = walk/duck/aim (hold up/down to look)\r\n - Dpad = walk/duck/aim (hold up/down to look)\r\n - Y = shoot\r\n - B = jump\r\n - X = hold for lightning beam (control angle with stick/dpad left/right)\r\n - A = powerline\r\n - R = grenade\r\n - L = cycle weapon type \r\n - ZR = smart bomb\r\n\r\n# Current Limitations\r\n\r\n - Don't try to remap buttons in the controls menu, it asks for a button press, but doesn't react to Joycon input. The only way out is to force quit the game with the home button. If you mess up preferences, just delete `/switch/Hurrican/hurrican.cfg`\r\n\r\n - The tutorial level (if you select \"Start Tutorial\" instead of \"Start New Game\") currently crashes just after loading.\r\n\r\n# Building\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/rsn8887/hurrican\r\ncd hurrican/Hurrican/src\r\nmake clean\r\nmake Hurrican_switch.zip -j12\r\n```\r\nthe zip file is created in the Hurrican folder, not in src.\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\nv1.02\r\n\r\n- Re-compiled with 12.0.0 support\r\n\r\nv1.01\r\n\r\n- Re-compiled with 9.0.0 support\r\n\r\nv1.00\r\n\r\n- First release on Switch","assets":[{"size":42637483,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/rsn8887/Hurrican/releases/download/v1.02-switch/Hurrican_1.02_switch.zip"}]}]
