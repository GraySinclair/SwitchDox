[{"tag_name":"1.0.2","name":"","body":"This minor update mainly fixes a sysmodule crash that happens when trying to poll temperatures on HOS >= 14.0.0.\r\n\r\nBecause one of the method to get precise temperatures  was removed, it also means that **starting HOS 14 you will no longer have decimal precision on \"PCB\" and \"SOC\" temperatures**.\r\n\r\nIncluded from develop since the last release:\r\n - Fix freqs on ResetToStock(); for Boost Mode GPU\r\n - libnx compat fixes\r\n - libtesla updated from upstream\r\n - Use ts:GetTemperature on HOS 14.0.0+ instead of ts:GetTemperatureMilliC\r\n - Release files dont enable logs by default anymore\r\n\r\nEDIT: The release files have been updated to match the tag version, and with the log flag removed by default. Thanks  to everyone who tested!","assets":[{"size":3525099,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/retronx-team/sys-clk/releases/download/1.0.2/sys-clk-1.0.2.zip"}]}]
