[{"tag_name":"v5.9.0","name":"hekate v5.9.0 & Nyx v1.4.0","body":"![hekate-nyx-banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3665130/60391760-bc1e8c00-9afe-11e9-8b7a-b065873081b2.png)\r\n\r\n**Supports booting ALL current CFWs, Android/Linux booting and payload tools.**\r\n**No more SD card removals**\r\n\r\n### Supports: Erista and Mariko units\r\n### Latest HOS supported: 15.0.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhekate 5.9.0 changes\r\n-------------\r\n- **HOS 15.0.0 full support**\r\n- **Fixed a regression on HOS 6.2.0** causing TSEC to hang hekate\r\n- **A new animated ticker line is now shown during bootlogo's delay time**\r\n It gives a nice visible feedback and a reminder to user to press VOL- if needed.\r\n It can be disabled by editing `hekate_ipl.ini` and setting `noticker=1` in `[config]` section. (GUI option may come later.)\r\n That only disables the ticker for custom bootlogos, not the default hekate one.\r\n- For new Mariko users, Auto HOS Power Off feature is now enabled by default\r\n Existing users, can enable it, as always, in Nyx -> Options -> Auto HOS Power Off.\r\n- Added an error message in case payload launching fails\r\n Previously it wouldn't show anything.\r\n- Support for new dram chips\r\n- Many under the hood improvements\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notice about Atmosphere 1.0.0 and up:** The `fss0=atmosphere/fusee-secondary.bin` in `hekate_ipl.ini` must be changed to `fss0=atmosphere/package3`. And make sure that `atmosphere/contents` folder does not have old Atmosphere components.\r\n**Notice about resized emuMMC:** Resized emuMMC does not have the slow bug anymore. You can create a new one or recreate it via Nyx and the issue will be gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemuMMC Changes\r\n-------------\r\n- **HOS 15.0.0 Support**\r\nbased on tree https://github.com/m4xw/emuMMC/tree/4714b2df9eaf68fb85516b35f7f4265ab0413825\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNyx v1.4.0 Changes\r\n-------------\r\n- **Fluid GUI for Mariko**\r\n Nyx now uses HW rotation which extremely improves render times on Mariko\r\n The slow and waterfall-like rendering is now gone.\r\n- **Black Theme support**\r\n Added experimental Black Theme aimed mostly for OLED panels.\r\n Can be enabled in Nyx Settings -> Color Theme -> Toggle Background.\r\n You need to select Save & Reload after that to really use it.\r\n For now it's experimental as it needs some tweaks here and there.\r\n- Added info about Switch Lite Sharp LQ055T1SW10 panel\r\n- Fixed an issue that would create a massive stutter each time a tap was done on a window\r\n Noticeable on Mariko devices since it would create a 1s stutter. (On Erista it's not visible.)\r\n- Nyx Options was renamed to Nyx Settings to avoid confusion with hekate/general Options\r\n- A warning icon together with reason is now shown if fuel gauge is in init state\r\n- The partition manager, now also does a backup of payload.bin in case a full backup is not possible\r\n Now the total of backed up items in such a case is: hekate/Nyx files (bootloader), Mariko Warmboot Storage (warmboot_mariko) and payload.bin.\r\n- Fixed an issue with XUSB which would break USB on Mariko in L4T after UMS usage\r\n- Fixed an issue where if user pressed the invisible padding buttons on a pop up, it would close it.\r\n- Fixed a heap corruption issue when entering emuMMC window which could hang Nyx\r\n- Improved various error messages\r\n- Many under the hood improvements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBDK Changes\r\n-------------\r\n- Display: Added driver for VIC HW logic that is used to manipulate frame/texture buffers\r\n- Display: Added Sharp LQ055T1SW10 panel defines\r\n- Dram: Added support for new ram chips\r\n- Power: RAM regulator on T210B01 SKUs can be now managed\r\n- Power: Improved 5V regulator management\r\n- XUSB: Finalized and optimized XUSB deinit\r\n- eMMC: emmc_end can now be used to deinit eMMC\r\n- I2C: Fixed an issue i2c packet send mode\r\n- PMC: Added more pmc scratch lock types\r\n- Fix a TSEC issue on 6.2.0 firmware\r\n- lib: strtol and atoi replaced with custom versions to remove re-entrancy baggage from stdlib\r\n- Various internal improvements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Click to expand FAQ notes</summary>\r\n\r\n- **Which Linux/Android distributions are supported in Partition Manager?**\r\n For L4T Linux you can use the official Ubuntu Bionic 3.4.0 and newer or any other distro betas.\r\n For android you can get Android 10.\r\n\r\n- **I don't care about emuMMC/Linux/Android. Can the Part manager be used for something else?**\r\n Yes. You can still reformat your SD card to a single FAT32 partition.\r\n You can even use it when you have exFAT and you want to format to FAT32.\r\n It is also suggested to format your sd card via hekate. That's because it prepares it for **performance**. something that many partitioning tools neglect.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nCheck [readme.md](./README.md) for more.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:**\r\nFor maximum performance of UMS in Windows, you need to run `nyx_usb_max_rate__run_only_once_per_windows_pc.reg`, only once per PC you have.\r\nIt only affects hekate's usb device. You can also view that file with text editor and see what it does. Linux/Mac OS users do not need that.\r\n\r\n# How to update:\r\n- Drag n drop `bootloader` folder into sd card root and hit merge/replace.\r\n **No need to delete that folder first**, especially if you want your configs and payloads.\r\n- You can choose to update your RCM injection device or PC with the new `hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin` or not.\r\n  In any case, `bootloader/update.bin`, will be checked and if newer it will get loaded.\r\n  `update.bin` is hekate and it is already copied with the `bootloader` folder drag n drop update process.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notice about Atmosphere 1.0.0 and up:** The `fss0=atmosphere/fusee-secondary.bin` in `hekate_ipl.ini` must be changed to `fss0=atmosphere/package3`. And make sure that `atmosphere/contents` folder does not have old Atmosphere components.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** Release is based on https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/tree/c0cc9c9f4f59b84452e0c34b2585c789532289d8\r\nIf you hang when you inject, redownload and apply the release because you have the older problematic Nyx.\r\n\r\n# Download:","assets":[{"size":636595,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/releases/download/v5.9.0/hekate_ctcaer_5.9.0_Nyx_1.4.0.zip"}]}]
