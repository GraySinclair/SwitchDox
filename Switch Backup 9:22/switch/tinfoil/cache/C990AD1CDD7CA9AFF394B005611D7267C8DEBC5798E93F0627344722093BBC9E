[{"tag_name":"2.3.1","name":"2.3.1: Small bug fixes","body":"- Amiigo will now validate that the local API cache is valid before using it, this prevents Amiigo crashing at startup if connection was lost during first setup\r\n- Fixed bug where function pointer was used as input to an if statement instead of the function's output during deinit. This function will likely never return false anyway\r\n\r\nIf you are on 2.3.0 and have experienced no crashes you don't need this update.","assets":[{"size":8407509,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/CompSciOrBust/Amiigo/releases/download/2.3.1/Amiigo.nro"}]}]
