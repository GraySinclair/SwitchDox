[{"tag_name":"v1.3.2","name":"v1.3.2","body":"This is a stable maintenance release. It features various bugfixes, optimizations, and minor features backported from the v1.4 development tree.\r\n\r\nThere are no gameplay changes and this version should be replay-compatible with the initial v1.3 release.\r\n\r\nSee the announcement [at our website](https://taisei-project.org/news/0013_v1.3.2).\r\n\r\n**For package maintainers:** this release no longer vendors the [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm) library; it is now treated as an external dependency. We encourage you to package cglm as well. However, if you still wish to build cglm as a part of Taisei, you can checkout its repository into `taisei/subprojects/cglm` or let Meson's wrap mechanism handle it. Note that Taisei only uses the inline functions from cglm headers and does not require linking to the library.\r\n\r\nThe pgp key used to sign the release artifacts has been changed. You can receive the new key with `gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 5F2EE4A69653CA07`","assets":[{"size":66657688,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/taisei-project/taisei/releases/download/v1.3.2/Taisei-1.3.2-linux-x86_64.tar.xz"}]}]
