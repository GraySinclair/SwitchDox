[{"tag_name":"april-fools-dos-2","name":"April Fools: DOS Release","body":"## April Fools!\r\nThis is a joke v2.0.0 release that ports FNFR's Week 6 (except Thorns due to issues) to DOS-compatible operating systems. A portable DOSBox-X setup with the game files is included below.\r\n\r\nA few post-April-Fools fixes have also been added to this release.\r\n\r\n## Original release notes\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53527582/161355261-15b82113-a3a8-4101-bab9-72aa8c4aad75.png)\r\n\r\nPrepare for the biggest update in Friday Night Funkin' Rewritten history.\r\n\r\n### What's new in v2.0.0\r\n* I am now taking a different approach to FNFR's development. In order to move forward, we must return to our roots. That is why I have decided to review computer history and develop FNFR for where it all started: MS-DOS.\r\n* Removed all weeks except Week 6, because they are too modern for this release.\r\n* Accepted the world of the 1980s.\r\n\r\n### Install instructions\r\n* **IBM-compatible PC**\r\n  * Refer to the instruction booklet included with your Friday Night Funkin' Rewritten floppy disk.\r\n* **\"Modern\" platform**\r\n  * If you are too modern to run FNFR as Jim Hall intended, download the the `funkin-rewritten-dos.zip` file and run `dosbox-x.exe`.\r\n  * Consider using a *real* computer.","assets":[{"size":29322034,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/HTV04/funkin-rewritten/releases/download/april-fools-dos-2/funkin-rewritten-dos.zip"}]}]
