[{"tag_name":"v1.4.0","name":"Fifth release","body":"- Fixed an issue where custom created amiibos were deleted.\r\n    - AmiiboGenerator will create an \"autogenerated.flag\" file inside the amiibo folder and only delete amiibos with that flag file.\r\n    - If you want to keep an autogenerated amiibo, remove that file\r\n- Because all amiibos will be deleted before generating new ones, if you create a folder structure that the tool wants to use too, it will skip generating/overwriting the files. Very unlikely but better safe than sorry.\r\n- Fixed an issue with an Animal Crossing Amiibo where the slash in its name would create an unexpected folder structure.\r\n\r\n**Due to the new update, you might need to manually delete the amiibos, as they lack the \"autogenerated.flag\" file and wont be deleted or overwritten by the new version of the tool.** You could delete all amiibos with 1.3.0, update and then generate them again.\r\n\r\nThis release shows as 1.3.0 on your switch.","assets":[{"size":1498118,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/Slluxx/AmiiboGenerator/releases/download/v1.4.0/AmiiboGenerator.nro"}]}]
