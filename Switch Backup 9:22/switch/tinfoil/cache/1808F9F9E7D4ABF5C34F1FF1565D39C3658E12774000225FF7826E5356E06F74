[{"tag_name":"v1.2.3","name":"v1.2.3","body":"**v1.2.3 Release:**\r\n- This release is for the PS Vita, PSP, and LÃ–VE versions. For other systems, go to [v1.1.9](https://github.com/LukeZGD/DDLC-LOVE/releases/tag/v1.1.9)\r\n\r\n**v1.2.3 Changes:**\r\n- Update script-ch30.lua\r\n- Add back PSP support\r\n\r\n**Post-release update:**\r\n- Added update pack for Vita users that already have v1.2.2 installed. To update from v1.2.2 to v1.2.3, extract the `.zip` to the root of `ux0:` and confirm to overwrite files.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n- Final release. With better ways to play DDLC on Switch and Vita platforms, DDLC-LOVE is no longer needed, and it will not be updated anymore.\r\n- For the PS Vita, I recommend using [Doki-Doki-Literature-Club-Vita](https://github.com/SonicMastr/Doki-Doki-Literature-Club-Vita) instead of DDLC-LOVE for the full desktop version (in Ren'Py) with support for mods.\r\n- For the Switch, support Team Salvato and buy DDLC Plus! The original DDLC (in Ren'Py) can also be run with Switchroot Ubuntu or Android with support for mods.","assets":[{"size":87496174,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/LukeZGD/DDLC-LOVE/releases/download/v1.2.3/DDLC-LOVE-PSP.zip"}]}]
