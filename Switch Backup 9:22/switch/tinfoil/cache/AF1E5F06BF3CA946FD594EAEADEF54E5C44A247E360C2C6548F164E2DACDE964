[{"tag_name":"nx4.7.1-1","name":"Switch Release 8","body":"## Changes\r\n* rebased port on latest upstream (4.7.1+);\r\n  * this means the GLES2 renderer is now available and functioning, which might benefit performance;\r\n  * the game should also now default to GLES2;\r\n* rebuilt with newest libraries.\r\n\r\n## Installation and running\r\n1. Unzip the attached ZIP file to the `switch` folder on your SD card.\r\n2. Place at least one supported IWAD (e.g. `doom2.wad`) into `gzdoom/iwads/`.\r\n3. Run GZDoom Launcher from hbmenu.\r\n\r\n## Known bugs\r\n* Startup takes a while.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* Launcher controls:\r\n  * `D-PAD`: navigation\r\n  * `L`/`R`: change tab\r\n  * `A`: activate option\r\n  * `B`: cancel/exit\r\n  * `X`: reset option\r\n  * `PLUS`: start game\r\n* You can technically place the game into any subfolder in `sdmc:/switch/`, as long as the `gzdoom` folder is next to `gzdoom_launcher.nro`.\r\n* Any custom files (PWADs, PK3s, DEHs, LMPs, whatever) should be placed into the `gzdoom/pwads` folder.\r\n* The launcher has predefined default profiles for most supported IWADs. You can also add your own profiles by pressing Y on the main tab. Any changes will be saved to `gzdoom/launcher.ini`.\r\n* The launcher will only detect files in `gzdoom/iwads` and `gzdoom/pwads`. You can use the `Override RSP file` option if you have to load files from other locations.\r\n* Multiplayer probably does work (or at least it did last time I checked), however only Switch <=> PC multiplayer has been tested. You can start a netgame from the launcher. Don't forget to change the player number from 1 and read the warning message.\r\n* The IP that's placed in the address field by default is your Switch's local IP, others can use that to connect to it if they're on the same network.\r\n* Only the player that hosts the game needs to set gameplay settings, however everyone has to pick the same set of custom files as the host.\r\n* Fatal errors are logged into `error.log`. You can also turn on logging in the launcher.\r\n","assets":[{"size":23200679,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/gzdoom/releases/download/nx4.7.1-1/gzdoom_nx_8.zip"}]}]
