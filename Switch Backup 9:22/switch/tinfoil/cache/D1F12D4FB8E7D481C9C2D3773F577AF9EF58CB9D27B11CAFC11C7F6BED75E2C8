[{"tag_name":"v1.4.0","name":"Version 1.4.0","body":"Today marks one year since the last update, so I thought I'd add a couple more features! This will likely be the last major update from myself as I have kind of lost interest in continuing development on NX-Activity-Log, however I plan to continue to support it by fixing any major bugs due to newer firmwares, etc.\r\n\r\nAs always, I appreciate all the support I've received regarding this software and I hope it continues to be of use to all of you who use it! :)\r\n\r\n### Changelog:\r\n* Added data export to JSON\r\n  * All data shown in the app (both Recent Activity 'events' and All Activity 'summaries' are exported\r\n  * See the [wiki](https://github.com/tallbl0nde/NX-Activity-Log/wiki) for the format of the JSON\r\n* Added a basic, experimental import from JSON\r\n  * **This only imports data to NX-Activity-Log, the system's log isn't touched**\r\n  * Data is only imported to Recent Activity due to limitations on merging All Activity\r\n* Added 'Adjust Playtime' setting\r\n  * This setting allows for the playtime shown in All Activity to be increased/decreased in order to make up for lost time, etc.\r\n  * These changes are applied on a per-user basis\r\n  * This may be useful when importing data as the import doesn't change the values shown in All Activity\r\n* Added 'Hide Titles' setting\r\n  * Titles can be marked as hidden in order to hide them from all screens in NX-Activity-Log\r\n  * These changes are applied across all users\r\n* Added Traditional Chinese translation\r\n* Translations now fallback to English if a string is missing\r\n  * Note: Translations haven't been updated yet so the newer features will only be shown in English\r\n* Improved title metadata parsing\r\n* Built with latest version of Aether\r\n  * Most of the \"heavy\" UI is now rendered asynchronously\r\n    * In simple terms, most of the app should now be more responsive\r\n* Built with latest libnx","assets":[{"size":10121093,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/tallbl0nde/NX-Activity-Log/releases/download/v1.4.0/NX-Activity-Log.nro"}]}]
