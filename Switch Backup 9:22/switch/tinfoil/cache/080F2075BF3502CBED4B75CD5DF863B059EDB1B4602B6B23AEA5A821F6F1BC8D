[{"tag_name":"v0.8.0","name":"MissionControl 0.8.0","body":"<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img alt=\"GitHub Releases\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/ndeadly/MissionControl/v0.8.0/total\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThis is the sixteenth official release of Mission Control.\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay! I had to change my code injection strategy due to this version of the `bluetooth` module not having enough free contiguous padding space to store my code. Many thanks to those who helped test the new patches :)\r\n\r\nThis release adds full support the recently released 15.0.x firmwares, including patches for pairing Wii/WiiU and Xbox Elite 2 controllers.\r\n\r\nBehaviour for controllers identifying as Dualshock 4 was also changed so that controllers aren't disconnected if the motion controls calibration can't be retrieved. Instead motion controls will simply be disabled. This fixes an issue where the Razer Raiju TE controller would no longer connect, due to its lack of motion support. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I now have a discord server! Come say hi https://discord.gg/gegfNZ5Ucz\r\n(thanks to @Banz99 for helping to set everything up)\r\n\r\nNew users landing on this release page should first check out the readme on the [main project page](https://github.com/ndeadly/MissionControl#readme) for the official project documentation. There you can find installation and usage instructions along with an FAQ section that will answer most of your questions.\r\n\r\n### Changelog:\r\n- Updated libraries for 15.0.x support.\r\n- Added bluetooth IPS patches for 15.0.x.\r\n- Dualshock 4 controllers are no longer disconnected if motion calibration retrieval fails.","assets":[{"size":131433,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/ndeadly/MissionControl/releases/download/v0.8.0/MissionControl-0.8.0-master-64f978e.zip"}]}]
