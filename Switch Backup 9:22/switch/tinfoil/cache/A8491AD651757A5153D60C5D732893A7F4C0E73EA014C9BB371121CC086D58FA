[{"tag_name":"3.4.0","name":"TI-Nspire release","body":"# Super Haxagon 3.4.0\r\n\r\n### About this build:\r\n\r\nMost systems haven't significantly changed across platforms. All have been tested on hardware. This is primarily a release for the TI-Nspire but I'll upload new builds here to keep them up to date.\r\n\r\nAs for the TI-Nspire build the credits and beatmaps are not currently working.\r\n\r\n⚠️ Install: Copy `haxagon.tns` AND `levels.haxagon.tns` into the `ndless` folder ⚠️\r\n\r\n### A summary:\r\n\r\nI've finally come back to what started my programming adventure. A simple app for a calculator. In 2013 I released the program \"Super Hexaspire\" as an alpha. At the time I had no idea that programming would turn into a career.\r\n\r\nSo here we are today, porting a game around to so many different platforms. Starting with the Nspire, moving to the 3DS, then to PC, then to the Switch, and finally back to the Nspire. Super Haxagon has been quite a project over the years and taught me many things about technology, and for that I am grateful. \r\n\r\n### Timeline:\r\n\r\n2013: TI-Nspire version Alpha\r\n2016: 3DS version 1\r\n2017: 3DS version 2 (Complete Rewrite)\r\n2020: 3DS version 3 (Complete Rewrite)\r\n2020: Windows and Linux release\r\n2020: Nintendo Switch release\r\n2021: TI-Nspire release\r\n\r\n### Thanks for playing!\r\n","assets":[{"size":18773272,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/RedTopper/Super-Haxagon/releases/download/3.4.0/linux-x86_64.zip"}]}]
