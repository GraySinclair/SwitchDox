[{"tag_name":"v1.2","name":"v1.2","body":"### Final Update(?)\r\n\r\nNew additions:\r\n- **Ported to PSP!**\r\n\t- I'm not sure if this works on a real PSP-1000 (the model with less RAM). It should work - it runs in PPSSPP set to PSP-1000 mode - but I haven't tested it myself on a real 1000 model.\r\n- **Added integer scaling option** (enabled by default) for resolutions that are smaller than the actual screen resolution\r\n\t- This replaces the old Fullscreen menu option (PC users can still toggle fullscreen by pressing F)\r\n\t- This does nothing on Android since the Android version always runs at native resolution; instead, Android gets a toggle for showing/hiding the top status bar\r\n- When using a resolution that's smaller than the screen's resolution, the window is now rendered to the center of the screen, meaning **consoles can now make better use of smaller resolutions**\r\n\t- This does not work on PSP since its version of SDL_RenderSetViewport() doesn't work properly\r\n\t- (Suggestion for handheld Switch and Wii U gamepad users - try setting the resolution to 720p/480p resolution respectively with integer scaling turned off for (very close to) native resolution on handheld! Widescreen 240p also looks great on these systems)\r\n- **Added a loading screen** upon booting the game instead of staying on a blank screen until everything is loaded\r\n- Added 240p, 272p, and 544p logos so **the logo now looks clearer** on those displays (like the Vita)\r\n- Added a few more **resolution options**\r\n- **Adjusted grid number positions on Vita** so they don't bleed into the grid\r\n- **Fixed a bug involving mouse/touch controls** when used alongside button controls\r\n- Fixed the background randomly jumping around upon loading a puzzle\r\n- Pressing L/R to change songs now saves the current song setting\r\n- The controls screen now properly reflects swapped Confirm/Back buttons\r\n- Reduced number of button presses required for the cheat from 10 to 8\r\n- **A LOT of other polish/minor bug fixes**\r\n\r\nThis will most likely be the final update; I've fixed all the bugs I know of, ported to all the systems I want to port to that support SDL2, and given a little something back to the PSP community that kicked off my interest in homebrew so many years ago. So...\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","assets":[{"size":5286754,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/Mips96/SuDokuL/releases/download/v1.2/SuDokuL-v1.2-switch.zip"}]}]
