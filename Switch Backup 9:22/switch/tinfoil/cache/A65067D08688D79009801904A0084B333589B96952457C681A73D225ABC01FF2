It needs a complete rewrite which will happen at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nMore bugfixes and a couple new additions\r\n\r\n**Additions:**\r\n* The app now contains an autoupdater and will update itself when it sees a new version available.\r\n* Version numbers are now displayed next to each package.\r\n* The download progress screens now have icons.\r\n  * In the future there will be a spinner to indicate the download is still active and the app is not frozen, but I need threading to get fixed in LovePotion first.\r\n\r\n**Fixes:**\r\n* The sdsetup.zip file downloaded to the SD card is now correctly deleted.\r\n* The app now exits to the home menu after a download to \"fix\" (workaround) a bug where hbmenu would hang if you tried to launch another app after downloading with SDSetup.\r\n  * This will be fixed properly in the future.","assets":[{"size":10514572,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/noahc3/sdsetup-switch/releases/download/v0.3-alpha/sdsetup-switch.nro"}]}]
