[{"tag_name":"2.0.0","name":"BotW Unexplored 2.0.0","body":"### 2.0\r\n* Added Shrines (+ DLC if it's present), Taluses, Hinoxes and Moldugas.\r\n* Added a legend where you can toggle which of the collectibles you want to see.\r\n* It's now possible to use the app while playing the game. This is achived by making backups of your savefile, which are then loaded while the game is running.\r\n* Added guides for finding the koroks. The text and images are taken directly from Zeldadungeons interactive map. Simply tap a korok and a guide will pop up. Very helpful for certain korok seeds that are hard to find with only a location on a map.\r\n* When a korok is selected, press B to manually mark it as complete. Very helpful if you're using the app while playing as the latest savedata can't be read. Otherwise you would have to remember all the koroks you've found during this play session, which could become difficult. The correct korok progress will be restored once the game has been closed.\r\n* \"Korok paths\" have also been added to help finding some koroks. If you've used Zeldadungeons interactive map, then you know what they are.\r\n* Added support for Master Mode. Press Y to toggle it.\r\n* Drastically improved performance when a lot of objects are displayed. Can easily run at 60fps now.\r\n* The app remebers your last camera position and zoom. This makes it easy to get back to the korok you looked at last time, if you for example switch between BotW and the app. (You can also press X in the Homebrew menu to star it for quicker access)\r\n* Now tries to load the last used user so you won't have to use the dialog picker every time you start the app.\r\n* Added more error messages and all logs are saved to a text file in case the app doesn't work","assets":[{"size":21308193,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/lud99/botw-unexplored/releases/download/2.0.0/botw-unexplored.nro"}]}]
