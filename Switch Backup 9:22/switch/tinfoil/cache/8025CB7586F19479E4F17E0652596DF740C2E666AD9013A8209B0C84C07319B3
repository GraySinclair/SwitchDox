[{"tag_name":"r1","name":"Release 1","body":"### Changelog\r\n* initial release.\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\n\r\n* The game takes a while to start and load levels.\r\n* Key binding menu does not display button names correctly.\r\n* Intro movies don't play, since the player is not implemented.\r\n\r\n### How to install\r\n\r\nThis requires access to the following system calls:\r\n* `svcMapProcessCodeMemory` (0x77)\r\n* `svcUnmapProcessCodeMemory` (0x78)\r\n* `svcSetProcessMemoryPermission` (0x73)\r\n\r\nI actually have no idea what that entails except the fact that you have to be running a CFW. Good luck.\r\n\r\nYou're going to need:\r\n* `.apk` file for version 1.7 (latest version at the time of writing) that includes `arm64-v8a` libraries;\r\n* `.obb` file for version 1.6 or 1.7 (usually located at `/sdcard/android/obb/com.rockstar.maxpayne/main.3.com.rockstar.maxpayne.obb`).\r\n\r\nBoth files [can be obtained](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11012976/how-do-i-get-the-apk-of-an-installed-app-without-root-access) from your phone if you have a copy of the game installed.\r\nBoth files can be opened or extracted with anything that can extract `.zip` files.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n1. Create a folder called `maxpayne` in the `switch` folder on your SD card.\r\n2. Extract **the contents of** the `assets` folder from your `.apk` to `/switch/maxpayne/`.\r\n3. Extract `lib/arm64-v8a/libMaxPayne.so` from your `.apk` to `/switch/maxpayne/`.\r\n4. Extract the contents of the `.obb` file into `/switch/maxpayne/`. You can skip all the `.msf` files except for `MaxPayneSoundsv2.msf` and any extra languages that you want.\r\n5. Extract the contents of the `.zip` file attached to this release into `/switch/maxpayne/`. Replace everything.\r\n\r\nThe game will show an error message if it detects that anything is wrong. Please read those and check the relevant parts of your setup.\r\n\r\nIf the error says `Could not find symbol ...`, that likely means you have the wrong `.apk`. You need one for v1.7, others **will not work**.\r\n\r\nIf the game crashes on startup, double check your setup and the closed issues. If you can't find a solution, please post an issue with your last crash report attached.\r\n\r\nThe port has an extra config file, located at `/switch/maxpayne/config.txt`. It is created when you first run the game and allows you to tweak some internal settings. For more detailed descriptions of said settings check the [wiki article](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/max_nx/wiki/Config-variables).\r\n","assets":[{"size":3202007,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/max_nx/releases/download/r1/MaxPayneNX_r1.zip"}]}]
