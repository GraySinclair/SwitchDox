[{"tag_name":"v0.20-nx2","name":"Switch release 2","body":"### Changelog\r\n* (at least partially) fix reading files from .pak archives (might fix the WON version of HL);\r\n* added a default `valve/liblist.gam` to the distribution (again, for WON versions).\r\n\r\n### Main changes compared to [old engine port](https://github.com/switchports/xash3d-switch)\r\n* based on xash3d-fwgs 0.20, bringing in all the new features (and bugs);\r\n* uses dynamic libraries for renderers and game code.\r\n\r\n### Installation guide\r\n1. Extract the attached zip file into the `switch` folder on your SD card.\r\n2. Copy the `valve` directory from your Half-Life installation (the Steam version) to `/switch/xash3d/` on your SD card. _**Don't replace anything if asked.**_\r\n    * The WON (GOTY, Day One, etc) versions of HL are technically not supported by the new engine, but should still work at least partially.\r\n3. Run `xash3d-fwgs` from Homebrew Menu.\r\n\r\n### Mods supported out-of-the-box\r\nThis release includes game libraries for the following games/mods:\r\n* Half-Life\r\n* Half-Life: Blue Shift\r\n* Half-Life: Opposing Force\r\n* Counter-Strike ([cs16-client](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/cs16-client/tree/switch-v1.32) and [regamelite](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/regamelite/tree/switch)).\r\n\r\nTo install a game/mod, copy its data folder (e.g. `bshift` for Blue Shift, `gearbox` for Opposing Force, `cstrike` for Counter-Strike) to `/switch/xash3d` _**without replacing anything**_. If you did everything correctly, you will see the game/mod you installed in the `Custom game` menu.\r\n\r\nAny Half-Life mods that don't use custom code (no `cl_dlls` or `dlls` in the mod folder, e.g. USS Darkstar) are also probably supported. Most other mods that do have custom code (e.g. Team Fortress Classic) require porting of their game libraries.\r\n\r\nCounter-Strike has bot support. Host a LAN game, then enter `bot_quota NUMBER` in the console, where  `NUMBER` is how many bots you want to have (you can also use the other bot commands, e.g. `bot_add`). However you probably won't be able to connect to other CS servers in the server list since the version of cs16-client is outdated and some of them only let in Android users.\r\n","assets":[{"size":33213533,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/xash3d-fwgs/releases/download/v0.20-nx2/xash3d-nswitch-r2.zip"}]}]
