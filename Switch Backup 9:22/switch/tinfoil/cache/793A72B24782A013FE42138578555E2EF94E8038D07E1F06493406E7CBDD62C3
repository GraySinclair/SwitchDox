[{"tag_name":"1.1","name":"1.1","body":"New features:\r\n\r\n* Added keyboard support. swkbd already supported it, but the menus can now be navigated entirely with a keyboard. Use F1 to open the command menu, down to scroll down and F2 at any point to exit.\r\n\r\nQuick recap of the controls (also in the readme):\r\n\r\n* Press `-` to open the system keyboard to enter commands (see the help command for more on the commands you can use).\r\n* Press down while the pager is active (there's a message about the pager) to display the next bit of text.\r\n\r\nTo use, simply extract the sd.7z and merge the resulting folder with your sdroot.","assets":[{"size":804364,"browser_download_url":"https://github.com/noirscape/delve/releases/download/1.1/delve.7z"}]}]
